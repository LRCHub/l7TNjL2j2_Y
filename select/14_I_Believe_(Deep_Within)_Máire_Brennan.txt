Yearning freedom
The angry man is dreaming
Can he do more?
Remembering tears
Memories linger
Your eyes are full of secrets
Can we see deep within?
Can we see those dreams?

Never lose the faith
From your faded heart
Never lose desire
To drift away

High emotions
Long, long road feels empty
Lonely highways
Tormenting my fears
The wind blows
Wherever it pleases
Will we see deep within?
Can we see those dreams?

Never lose the faith
From your faded heart
Never lose desire
To break the chains

Seas will roll on
Sun will keep on rising
Reasons given
On reaching for hope
Carry moments
No longer for lamenting
I believe deep within
You will see those dreams
